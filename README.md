## What is NetScan?

The project's goal is to create a set of tools to help developers implement applications easily, this library includes the most recent patterns and tools in the Android framework. 
Bellow we can see some tools present in this project:

- Port scan.
- Find a device by IP (Ping).
- Find devices inside a domestic network.
- Verify internet connection.
- List Wifi nearby.
- Internet connection speed.

## How to use NetScan?

### First step:
To use the library, include the JitPack repository URL inside the file `settings.gradle`, like the example below:
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
If the approach above does not work or your project is configured in other way, update the file `build.gradle` like that:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
	  ...
	  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

### Second step:
Include the library dependency inside your project `build.gradle`:

```
dependencies {
    implementation `com.github.gustavobarbosab:netscan:VERSAO'
}
```
